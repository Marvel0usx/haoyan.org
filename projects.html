                        This visualizer is my attempt to understand Python's interpreter.Therefore, the core of this visualizer is written in C. Since I just had a course teaching C in the previous 
                        semester, I planned merely to write...
                    </summary>
                    <span>a bunch of C code to boost the speed up. Admittedly, the amount of calculation 
                        is not that intense in this case. Still, it does not fail for an experiment. I then studied the official documentation provided by Python, read 
                        the source code in Python's GitHub. After weeks of trying, I finished my C implementation for the core. 
                        However, the pride of completing this project is so insignificant compared to my eagerness to learn more about 
                        the mechanism behind the scene. I, therefore, began seeking better resources to learn. Finally, I arrived at 
                        a course online offered by UCSD, talking about Python's interpreter. <s> As if Gollum finally found his precious,</s> 
                        I started immediately to follow this course. In this course, I studied every single nitty-gritty in the Python's 
                        main interpreter loop; the implementation of Python's object; marveled at the idea of structural subtyping to 
                        make OOP out of C code; comprehended the relation of function, frame, closure, and code object; and learned 
                        the mechanism of generator. It was such an unexpected journey that I took in those weeks, and the knowledge 
                        had finally satisfied me.

                        <q>Emotional YouTube</q> is developed during and after the UofTHacks VI by Jenna Lu and I. It is a browser extension for Chrome.
                        This is the very first application that I  wrote with more than two languages, Python for the backend, and HTML/CSS/Js for 
                        the frontend. The idea of...
                    </summary>
                    <span><q>wordcloud</q> is also amazingly handy when representing several keywords and their weight. 
                        This project is fairly straightforward: for backend, I will use Flask + SqlAlchemy to host the restful API, flask-Marshmellow 
                        for the schema of our database, and google's API to acquire data and analyze; for the frontend, I will then write a 
                        webpage to display the result.</span>
                    <p>However, as the saying goes, the juicier your expectation is, the more shriveled you will get, the implementation 
                        never comes as easy as I imagined. To retrieve the comments of youtube videos, I initially made use of the combo - 
                        selenium, requests, and BeautifulSoup - to write a web-crawler. I employed selenium to scroll the page down and 
                        scrape HTML snippets out of youtube. I used BeautifulSoup to parse those HTML to obtain the comments. After the 
                        whole night, despite how hilarious the idea was, I managed to download thousands of comments in such an unspeakably 
                        disgraceful manner. At that time, the application needs two minutes to generate its analysis. That was intolerable, 
                        and I had to improve it. Using web-crawler to obtain data is like fighting an up-will battle - the data hide safely, 
                        and I have to search for it, arrived at it, and parse it - whereas using an API is way faster. Once I realized there 
                        must exist some sort of API that achieves the same thing, I found google's youtube data v3 out of thin air. After 
                        conquering the difficulty of data gathering, I quickly finished the analysis and word cloud part of the project.</p>
                    <p>Having the backend finished, I started to work on the frontend. Given that this was the first time I did frontend, 
                        I learned a lot again. The first thing was styling the page, and it took me hours to figure out a way to make the 
                        app nice looking and organized. I stumbled through setting negative margins, using <code>transform: translate()</code>, 
                        floating icon to the left, flex boxes, until finally, I found the <em>grid</em> layout the handiest. Though the 
                        problem was tiny, I was amazed by the number of options that js&CSS provide to me - it is the infinity nature of 
                        coding. Then, I worked with javascript for several days, learned about ajax requests, CORS and base-64 encoding of 
                        image.</p>
                    <p>I finally finished this project, I was bewildered by the charm of js, and the agility of web-dev (in comparison to 
                        Tkinter and Qt). And not too surprisingly, this experience led me to the development of this site. At last, I remebered the quote that goes, 
                        <q>Let's start with ridiculous and work backwards, and that is how this was. xxx</q></p>

## Develop Notes

Being the first website that I developed, this site is majorly implemented using vanilla Js, HTML5, and CSS3. It is rudimentary yet very robust and independent of third-party libraries. The developing notes are as follows.

### Some of the highlights in the implementation

- lazy-loading of images using intersection observer;
- decorations using ::before and ::after pseudo-elements;
- page transitions using iframe elements;
- animations and transitions in CSS, directing by Js;
- minimalistic design;
- grid and flexbox layout;

### Future Improvements

To further the initiative of this website, I will work on several new aspects of the current implementation has to be improved, and these including:

- [x] improve the frame rate when rendering the animations;
- [x] use postMessage for media control;
- [x] change to a SPA if possible;
- [] turn the home page to a long-scrolling page;
- [] add blog page.

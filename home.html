                This is the home page of Haoyan (Harry) Wang, a third-year undergraduate student at the University of
                Toronto. He studies
                computer science and focuses on Artificial Intelligence. He will graduate in 2022 and head his way to
                the
                industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                During these years of studying, Harry has acquired a handful of useful skills in computer science. He
                made
                several
                side-projects in his interests. These include a Chrome extension that analyses the comments in the
                YouTube
                video, a visualizer
                for Conway's Game of Life, a widget that helped him book badminton courts (at the time he was obsessed
                with
                it), several
                web-based games, and this site itself. Harry loves using the knowledge he just acquired into practice to
                accomplish something
                intriguing and profound. Therefore, his recent work is an AR guitar algorithm that could help millions
                of
                people learn guitar sorely by
                themselves. How exciting that is!
            </p>
            <p>
                In his daily life, Harry manages different roles. He is an excellent team player, a responsible
                developer, a
                self-taught
                graphic designer, a guitar player, an amateur photographer, and a lover for music. Upon the day he got
                his
                first camera from
                his family, Harry began his journey to the digit world. He has hitherto been shooting with DSL and using
                Photoshop for more than
                seven years and has let the skills to brew with the time elapsed. You can find his works by navigating
                through the
                sidebar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before you leave this site, Harry wishes that you would like to spare a minute to listen to the sound
                you
                just made with the
                guitar on the left :)
            </p>
            <p>
                And have a good day!
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the home page of Haoyan (Harry) Wang, a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. He studies 
                computer science and focuses on Artificial Intelligence. He will graduate in 2022 and head his way to the industry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                During these years of studying, Harry has acquired a handful of useful skills in computer science. He made several 
                side-projects in his interests. These include a Chrome extension that analyses the comments in the YouTube video, a visualizer 
                for Conway's Game of Life, a widget that helped him book badminton courts (at the time he was obsessed with it), several 
                web-based games, and this site itself. Harry loves using the knowledge he just acquired into practice to accomplish something 
                intriguing and profound. Therefore, his recent work is an AR guitar algorithm that could help millions of people learn guitar sorely by 
                themselves. How exciting that is!
            </p>
            <p>
                In his daily life, Harry manages different roles. He is an excellent team player, a responsible developer, a self-taught 
                graphic designer, a guitar player, an amateur photographer, and a lover for music. Upon the day he got his first camera from 
                his family, Harry began his journey to the digit world. He has hitherto been shooting with DSL and using Photoshop for more than 
                seven years and has let the skills to brew with the time elapsed. You can find his works by navigating through the 
                sidebar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before you leave this site, Harry wishes that you would like to spare a minute to listen to the sound you just made with the 
                guitar on the left :)
            </p>
            <p>
                And have a good day!
            </p>

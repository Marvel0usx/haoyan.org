                This is the home page of Haoyn (Harry) Wang, a third-year undergraduate student in the University of Toronto.
                He studies computer science and focus in the Artificial Intelligence. He will in 2022 and head his way to the industry and 
                the society.
            </p>
            <p>
                During these years of studying, Harry has acquired a handful of intriguing skills in computer science. He made a number 
                of side-projects in his interests. These include a Chrome extension that analysis the comments in YouTube video, a visualizer
                for Conway's Game of Life, a widget that helped him to book a badminton courts (at the time he was obsessed with it), several
                web-based game, and this site itself. Harry loves using the knowledge he just acquired to develop something, something 
                intriguing, and profound. Therefore, the recent work of his is an AR guitar algorithm that could help millions of people to
                play guitar sorely by them selves. How exciting that is!
            </p>
            <p>
                In his daily life, Harry has a bunch of roles to play. He is an excellent team player, a responsible developer, a self-taught 
                graphic designer, a guitar player, an amateur photographer, and also a lover for music. Upon the day he got his first camera 
                from his grandma, Harry began his journey to the world of digit. He has hitherto been shooting with DSL and using Photoshop 
                for more than 7 years, and has let the skills to participated with the time elapsed by. His works are shown in the page that can 
                be seen by playing the cord "AGBe."
            </p>
            <p>
                Before you leave this site, Harry wishes that you would like to spare a minute to listen to the sound you just made with the 
                guitar on the left :)
            </p>
            <p>
                And have a good day!
